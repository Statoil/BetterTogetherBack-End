**Disclaimer:** BetterTogether is an application made by summer interns in Equinor during the summer of 2018 for which purpose is to visualise and encourage pair programming. As the project is no longer in use nor maintained, the repository is archieved.

# BetterTogether Backend [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Statoil/BetterTogetherBack-End.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Statoil/BetterTogetherBack-End)

This is the database and web display for the Better Together project.
The purpose of this project is to log and encourage pair programming in a team by
getting rewarded when reaching a set number of pair programming events.

## Installation

The following environment variables must be defined in the [Dockerfile](https://github.com/Statoil/BetterTogetherBack-End/blob/master/Dockerfile):
- BT_TOKEN: to access the web page and REST api endpoints
- SLACK_TOKEN: token provided by slack that gives access to channels in slack
- SLACK_CHANNEL: channel id found in the slack channel url
- POSTGRES_USERNAME: credentials for postgres database
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD: credentials for postgres database
- POSTGRES_HOSTNAME: hostname for postgres database

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) and build an image
    ```docker image build -t <name_of_image>:<name_of_tag> .```

Start a running container associated with the image:
    ```docker run -p 80:80 <name_of_image>:<name_of_tag>```

## Interaction
All communication with the REST api and webview must provide a token parameter to validate.

Example:
    ```http://0.0.0.0/api/user/all?token=EXAMPLE```

You will use the app from BetterTogether to add pairs when you have pair programmed.
Everything else can be accessed through curl.

Changing thresholds:
    ```curl -X put <yourlink>/api/threshold/update/<reward_type>/<your threshold>```

Using rewards:
    ```curl -X put <yourlink>/api/reward/use/<reward_type>```

Change lifetime of edges in webview:
Add a url parameter after the token representing the lifetime of the edges in number of days as follows:
    ```http://0.0.0.0?token=EXAMPLE&days=20```

Reset database:
Uncomment ```db.drop_all()``` in **set_up_db()** in [routes.py](https://github.com/Statoil/BetterTogetherBack-End/blob/master/backend/DB/api/routes.py)
